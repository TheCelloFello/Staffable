# Staffable
Calhacks 6.0 2019 Project

Staffble was designed and coded by Todd Yu and Dylan Reimer over the course of two days for
the Calhacks 6.0 hackathon at UC Berkeley. The purpose of the app is to provide a platform
connecting unemployed individuals with short term positions offered by employers like 
resturaunts and farms. The app allows employers to list positions with attributes like title,
pay, and description, and potential employees can use the search feature to find these positions.
The app implements Google's Firebase to store login information and utilizes a custom API to 
authenticate login information. The front end of the app was drafted in Figma and designed 
in xCode. The entire app was built with little prerequisite knowledge of APIs, xCode, or Firebase,
and proved to be an immense and valuable learning experience.
